        <h2>Reflection Of ATM</h2>
        <img src="images/info-tech.jpeg" alt="another picture of keyboard" width="400">
        <p>
            Overall, the ATM Program has been one of the best classes I have ever had, and Most likely will be the best I will ever have. Everything this program offered I could relate to. So many things in this program helps with future jobs, especially since I want to be a game developer. I’m a technology kid, after all.
