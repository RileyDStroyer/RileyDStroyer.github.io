                If you put any piece of technology in front of me, I can use it. I am very skilled with all types of technology, from computers to phones. I am also skilled in gaming, and I know how to solve a Rubik’s Cube.

                I love to use technology for many reasons, with my biggest example, gaming. And just recently I have gotten into Rubik’s Cubes.

                Throughout my 3 years at bancroft, I haven’t been in much clubs. I’ve been in Genius Bar, a club where groups of students who are interested in technology, help other students, teachers, and staff with technology, for about 2 years.
